#Run the ‘tail -f /var/log/syslog‘ command in background

tail -f /var/log/syslog &

#The -f option causes tail to not stop when end of file is reached,
#but rather to wait for additional data to be appended to the input.

#If you want to push a command into the background, using & at the end is an easy way to do that.
#It comes with a catch, though. Using & doesn’t disconnect the command away from you;
#it just pushes it in the background so you can continue using a terminal.
#
#command &
#
#When the terminal session is closed, the command ends.
#Using & is good if you need to push something off for a bit,
#but don’t expect it to continue forever.
