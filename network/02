# Identify and display the Ethernet interface characteristics:

# (a) Identify broadcast address
# A broadcast address is an IP address that is used to target all systems on a specific subnet network instead of single hosts.

# (b) Identify all IP addresses which are part of the same subnet

# Ethernet is a family of computer networking technologies 
# commonly used in local area networks (LAN), metropolitan area networks (MAN)
# and wide area networks (WAN).

The -v flag may be used to get more verbose status for an interface.
mask =255.255.255.240

implies each subnet increments by 16

subnets are
192.168.32.0 
192.168.32.16
192.168.32.32
192.168.32.48..............etc
your address 192,168.32.x is in subnet 192.168.32.0

broadcast address is 192.168.32.15
