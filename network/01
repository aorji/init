# Get the list of the network interfaces of the machine without displaying any detail
# for these interfaces. Only the list of names.

# A network interface is the point of interconnection between a computer and a private 
# or public network. A network interface is generally a network interface card (NIC), 
# but does not have to have a physical form. Instead, the network interface can be 
# implemented in software.

# If you'd like to view the configuration of all network interfaces on the system 
#(not just the ones that are currently active), you can specify the -a option, like this: ifconfig -a

# The -l flag may be used to list all available interfaces on the system, with no
# other additional information.  Use of this flag is mutually exclusive with all
# other flags and commands, except for -d (only list interfaces that are down) and
# -u (only list interfaces that are up).
