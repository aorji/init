#For example, we have the `df` command. It lets you know what disk space is currently used.

#top` which can display the linux processes that are in use currently

#`ps` which, on the other hand, allows the moment to tell the processes that are running.

#`ifconfig` what is it for? It is used to configure and also display the network interfaces of your system.

#`ping` which allows to send a packet to another server for example. And the remote server does what?
He is playing ping pong with us and so he sends us the ball, he sends us a pong we see on our screen.

#`netstat`, which allows to display the connections on our server currently, the ports used, etc

#`traceroute` actually allows to display from point A to a point B, the path list of your package.

#For example, we use the `hosts` file. So `` what`s what? It allows to define an IP, a name manually.
Basically for example we have slash16.org which is local on a virtual machine that has an IP in 192.168.1.1,
we say that slash16.org is 192.168.1.1 and we defined it in this file there.

#Then we have the `networks` file which allows it to give a logical name to a network.
So for example we have all the IP in 192.168.1 from 1 to 254 we say that in fact this
is the network slash16. And in fact it allows to define more simply your network.

#`host.conf` file. So what is it for? It allows to say who decides what.
In simpler terms we will say it allows to say if it is actually a configuration file that resolves the domain
names or if it is the service `bind` through the DNS servers.

#`resolve.conf` file, which allows you to define your name servers, so DNS.
On top of that you can put that for example I use the Google name server which is 8.8.8.8
And so it allows you to use a different server than what your provider gives you or the one that 42 uses.

#`interface` file that is in` / etc / network`.
And so this file allows you to configure all of your system interfaces concerning the network.
So basically, you can define that your ethernet interface is called eth0 it uses DHCP,
so basically it gets an IP from your DHCP server, or you set it a static IP.
